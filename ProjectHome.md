The protoclipse plug-in generates java code from Google Protocol Buffers ".proto" files.

To make full use of the generated code, the Google Protocol Buffers jar files must be available to the project (e.g., as a library dependency.)

For more information about Google Protocol Buffers see http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/.

To install, choose "Help", "Install New Software..." and enter the protoclipse update site URL.  The update site URL is http://protoclipse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/site/.
